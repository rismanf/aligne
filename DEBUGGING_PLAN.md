# Admin Booking Functionality - Debugging Plan

## Issues Identified:

1. **Missing `is_guest` cast in User model** - The field exists but not properly cast as boolean
2. **Potential validation issues** - Some validation rules might be too strict
3. **Missing error handling** - No proper error display in the view
4. **Reformer position loading issue** - The relationship chain might be broken

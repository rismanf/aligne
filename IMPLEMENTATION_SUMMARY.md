The migration will automatically transfer data from `user_produks` to `user_memberships`.

### 3. Update Group Classes with Categories:
```sql
UPDATE group_classes SET 
    category = 'reformer',
    level = 'beginner',
    is_active = 1
WHERE name LIKE '%reformer%';

UPDATE group_classes SET 
    category = 'chair',
    level = 'beginner', 
    is_active = 1
WHERE name LIKE '%chair%';

UPDATE group_classes SET 
    category = 'functional',
    level = 'beginner',
    is_active = 1
WHERE name LIKE '%functional%';
```

### 4. Create Sample Membership Packages:
```sql
-- Example: Update existing products or create new ones
UPDATE products SET 
    name = 'The Core Series',
    description = '4x Reformer / Chair Class',
    price = 980000,
    valid_until = 20,
    is_active = 1
WHERE id = 1;
```
